                <h2>Rohu Fish Curry</h2>
                <p>Rohu fish curry is a kind of spicy fish preparation with tomato base gravy. Here the rohu fish is
                    marinated in turmeric powder and salt, then golden fried in mustard oil. The fried fish is then
                    cooked
                    in a spiced tomato onion based gravy. Thus, resulting in a tender fish having absorbed the wonderful
                    flavors of the gravy. This fish curry is best served with a piping hot steamed rice.</p>

                <h2>Egg Curry</h2>
                <p>
                    Egg being the wonderful source of proteins can be used to make many delicious dishes. One such
                    amazing
                    dish is that of Egg Masala Curry where boiled eggs are just simmered in spicy masala gravy. It has a
                    nice tangy taste of tomatoes coupled with the flavors and taste of the spices that are used. You can
                    always use leftover eggs from the breakfast or a party and toss it in a curry when you doesn't feel
                    like
                    cooking elaborate dishes but still like to have a delicious, scrumptious meal for dinner.
